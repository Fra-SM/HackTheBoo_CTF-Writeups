# HackTheBoo_CTF-Writeups

This is a collection of writeups of the challenges I solved during the HackTheBoo CTF in October 2022. The challenges were divided into 5 different categories: 
- Web
- Reversing
- Pwn
- Crypto
- Forensics

This was my first hacking competition. The event was individual and beginner-aimed. I solved a total of 12/25 challenges and ranked 448th out of 6367 players.
